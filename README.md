# Trailer Website

This website is intended to display some of my favorite movies and TV shows. Clicking on a tile will bring up the trailer for that feature. The site is also meant to demonstrate how to use OOP in Python to generate a site such as this.

## Requirements
* [Python 2.7] (https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2710/)
* A web browser

## Quick Start
* Download this project's folder, with all the files it contains
* Change directory to the downloaded folder
* Execute entertainment_center.py, e.g. "python entertainment_center.py" in a Linux terminal
* A new browser tab (or browser, if yours was closed) should open and take you to the site. Click around and enjoy!
